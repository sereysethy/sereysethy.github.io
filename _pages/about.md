### About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Computer 
Science, University of Namur.
My work focuses on cybersecurity, with a particular interest in intelligent 
defense mechanisms.
This includes the use of adaptive (or intelligent) honeypot systems that learn to interact with threat actors.

In my PhD dissertation, I proposed an abstract model for adaptive 
self-guarded honeypots called **ASGARD**, which can be instantiated to 
create various adaptive honeypot systems. These systems can be tailored to 
different use cases, support diverse communication protocols, and operate 
in multiple deployment modes.

Beside an excellent academic background, I have a strong background in software development, with deep knowledge of algorithms, data structures, 
and the software development lifecycle. 
I previously led a development team of more than 10 people in building a 
complex ledger system and an authoring platform for a multimedia company.

### Research Interests

* Intrusion detection systems using adaptive honeypots
* Applied machine learning in cybersecurity, including reinforcement learning
